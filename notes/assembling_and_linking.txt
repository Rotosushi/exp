so, we want to call the standard GNU binutils as and ld.

as needs the source assembly file that exp created as well as the 
target object file name

ld needs the source object file, plus the directory where the standard libraries 
are kept, and the ouput exectuable name.

this raises an interesting question, namely where do we place the standard libraries?
for now, during this early stage, where they go in the build directory is good enough.
but this is an important question to consider if we ever reach the stage of installing 
exp on a target system. I do think the answer is /usr/local/lib64/
because these are x64 target libraries, and they are intended to be installed 
per user.
