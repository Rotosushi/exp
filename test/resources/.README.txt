a test resource is a file containing valid exp code and has it's exit 
code added to it as if it were a file extension:

	test_resource.0.exp


files that start with '.' will not be gathered as an active test.

all files in all directories at or below test/resources/ will be checked 
for files, and all of them will be considered test resource files.
